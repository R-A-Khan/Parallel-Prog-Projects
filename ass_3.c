/* Exercise to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using
 a brute force Monte Carlo approach. Your task is to convert the serial
 computation to a parallel computation. The code has to print the
 current shortest total traveling distance found fairly frequently, so 
 you can monitor its progress.

 We use random number generator rand_r() specifically because it is thread-safe
 (it doesn't keep anything in a global state; everything is defined by the 
 variable "seed", which can be made private to the thread). 

 MPI: let rank 0 compute the initial distance matrix, and send it to other ranks.
 The timing (both serial and MPI code) should be done from right before sending 
 the distance matrix to other ranks, until right before printing the result by
 rank 0 (so it should include all MPI operations on rank 0, except for MPI_Init and 
 MPI_Finalize). The rank 0 has to print both the shortest distance and the
 corresponding itinerary.

 MPI: You should get the correct result for any N_MC (that is, N_MC doesn't have
 to be integer dividable by the number of ranks.

 OpenMP: you only have to parallelize the code located between the
 "----------" comment lines. So e.g. don't bother to compute the
 distance matrix in parallel - keep it as it is. The reason for
 that is the distance matrix calculations scale as N^2, whereas the
 minimum traveling distance calculations scale as (N-1)! (N is the number
 of cities), so for N>6 the former becomes totally negligible compared
 to the latter in terms of CPU cycles.

 Make sure the parallel code produces correct results, both in terms of
 the smallest distance found and the corresponding itinerary. To do
 this, run both the serial and parallel versions of the code for a small
 number of cities, N_CITIES - say 10 or 11, and identical total number
 of Monte Carlo steps, N_MC. Make sure N_MC is a few times larger than
 the factorial of (N_CITIES-1), so despite the random nature of the
 search you are almost guaranteed to find the exact solution.

 Your speedup should be close to the number of threads/ranks you are using.
 Say, on orca development nodes (24 threads) speedup should be >~23.

 For convenience, you can develop the code with smaller numbers (N_CITIES=10,
 N_MC=1e7). For final timing tests use N_CITIES=11 and N_MC=1e8.


 - Don't change the way the cities coordinates are initially randomly
 generated on the host (this will make it difficult to judge
 the code performance).

 - Don't forget that int can only handle integers up to ~4 billion. 

 - As this is Monte Carlo simulation, don't forget that in a parallel
 version each thread/rank has to start with a unique seed number.

 - Try to minimize the impact of a critical region as much as possible
 (OpenMP).

 - In OpenMP, experiment with different loop schedules - you might see
 big difference. Find the most efficient kind of schedule for this setup.
